# Silent Error in HTML: Setting innerHTML of a Non-Existent Element

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML where attempting to modify the `innerHTML` of a non-existent element results in a silent failure.  The JavaScript code executes without throwing an error, even though the intended action doesn't occur.

## Bug Description

The `bug.html` file contains a script that tries to set the `innerHTML` property of an element with the ID 'nonExistentElement'.  Since this element is not present in the HTML document, the operation fails silently. There's no error message in the browser's console to alert the developer of the issue.  This makes debugging such errors more challenging.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.html` file demonstrates a solution using a conditional check to ensure that the element exists before attempting to modify its `innerHTML`.
